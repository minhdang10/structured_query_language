What happens is that you join order positions with customer payments. But all they have in common is the order they refer to. A single payment doesn't relate to a single order position. What you really want to do is join the customers' order totals (which you get by aggregating the orders' positions) with the customers' payments (which you get by aggregating the payments). 


This is a typical issue when dealing with N-M relationships. To solve it, one solution is to move the aggregation to subqueries:

SELECT c.customername, o.amt - p.amt AS Net_Balance
FROM customers c 
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT ord.customernumber, SUM(det.quantityordered * det.priceeach) as amt
    FROM orders ord
    INNER JOIN orderdetails det ON ord.ordernumber = det.ordernumber
    GROUP BY ord.customernumber
) o ON o.customernumber = c.customernumber
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT customernumber, SUM(amount) as amt
    FROM payments
    GROUP BY customernumber
) p ON p.customernumber = c.customernumber
